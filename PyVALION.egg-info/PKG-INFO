Python implementation for the ionospheric model validation. 

# Installation

PyVALION may be installed from PyPi, which will handle all dependencies.

```
pip install PyVALION
```

You may also clone and install PyVALION from the GitHub repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/victoriyaforsythe/PyVALION.git
cd /path/to/PyVALION
python -m build .
pip install .
```

For more details about the dependencies, see the documentation.

# Example

PyVALION currently provides the ionospheric electron density and associated profile
parameters on a user-specified grid for all times on a requested day.  For
example,

```
import PyVALION.main_library as ml

# This example uses 15 April 2020, with an F10.7 of 150.0 sfu
(alon, alat, alon_2d, alat_2d, aalt, ahr, f2, f1, epeak, es_peak, sun, mag,
 edens_prof) = ml.run_iri_reg_grid(2020, 4, 15, 150, hr_res=1, lat_res=1,
                                   lon_res=1, alt_res=10, alt_min=0,
				   alt_max=700, ccir_or_ursi=0)
print(edens_prof.shape)
```

The resulting electron density profile (`edens_prof`) will have a shape of
12 x 70 x 2701.  More examples are available in the documentation.
